# Project 1 - Web Application Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview
This project is a **Web Application Vulnerability Scanner** built using Python and Flask.  
It helps identify common web vulnerabilities such as **XSS, SQL Injection**, and **missing security headers** in web applications.

The scanner is intended for **educational purposes** and **authorized penetration testing only**.

---

## Features
- Crawls web pages to detect HTML forms.
- Tests form inputs for:
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
  - **SQL Injection (SQLi)**
- Checks the main URL for **missing security headers**:
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - Referrer-Policy
  - Permissions-Policy
  - Strict-Transport-Security (for HTTPS)
- Logs all discovered vulnerabilities into a local **SQLite database**.
- Displays scan results in a **user-friendly HTML interface**.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Flask** (web framework)
- **Requests** (HTTP client)
- **BeautifulSoup4** (HTML parsing)
- **SQLite3** (database)

---

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the project folder).
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. **Install required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install flask requests beautifulsoup4
    ```
4. **Ensure the following project structure**:
    ```
    Project 1 - Web Application Vulnerability Scanner/
    ├── app.py
    ├── scanner.py
    ├── crawler.py
    ├── vulnerabilities.db (auto-created)
    └── templates/
        ├── index.html
        └── results.html
    ```

---

## Usage

1. Run the Flask app:
    ```bash
    python3 app.py
    ```
2. Open a browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000
    ```
3. Enter the **target URL** to scan.
4. View the **scan results**, including detected vulnerabilities and missing headers.

---

## Important Notes
- Only scan websites you **own or have explicit permission** to test.
- This project is for **learning and cybersecurity practice purposes only**.
- The SQLite database `vulnerabilities.db` stores all scan logs.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Support for more OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
- Directory Traversal detection.
- Export scan results to CSV or PDF.
- Multi-threaded scanning for faster performance.
